	<p>Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.</p>
	<p>Entity Framework is actively developed by the Entity Framework team which is assigned to the Microsoft Open Tech Hub and in collaboration with a community of open source developers. Together, we are dedicated to creating the best possible data access experience for .NET developers.</p>

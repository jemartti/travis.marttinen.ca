	<p>During my 4A term at the University of Waterloo, I took a course titled CS467 (Introduction to Quantum Information Processing). Instead of a final exam, we were tasked with writing an expository paper. Our goal was to understand a new concept in quantum information by reading original sources, and then to communicate this concept clearly and concisely (with a target audience of other students in the course). I chose to write this paper on Linear Optics Quantum Computation.</p>
	<h3 class="head3">abstract</h3>
	<p>Numerous possible protocols have been proposed for quantum computers, but there is no clear best implementation at this point in time. One possibility is linear optical quantum computing. As with every proposed implementation, optical quantum computing has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
	<p>Throughout this paper, we will discuss the fundamental requirements for an optical quantum computer and the groundbreaking KLM (Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn) proposal, as well as resultant improvements and suggestions. The possible errors related to realistic physical optical components are summarized, along with schemes for error correction to overcome these inevitable errors. Finally, we briefly touch on the future of linear optical quantum computing.</p>

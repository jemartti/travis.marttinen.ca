	<p>This sauna was designed and built for a family of Finns, and is located right next to an epic swimming pond. Smooth circulation methods were developed to ease the congestion of kids running in and out between sauna to swimming and change room. The sauna has two doors: one for the change room, and one for the pond. Simple.</p>
	<p>Barn doors slide right wide open to bring the outdoors into the changeroom. In fact, the whole structure is set on one huge pad, marrying the sauna floor with the outside floor for continuity.</p>
	<p>The window on the front of the sauna faces directly onto the pond and forest beyond for stunning views while bathing and drinking kalja.</p>
	<p>The house&#8211;shaped firewood storage nook was created to maintain a convenient and steady fuel supply for the eternally hungry sauna stove.</p>
	<p>Storage bench. Lie back on it for a bit and enjoy the spinning stars after jumping into the icy water.</p>
	<p>Construction and final photography are to be completed in the spring.</p>

	<p>This sauna is essentially not really a cube, but its name was bred from its design roots. When it was first designed and created, it was intended to sit inside a low garage, and be moveable if needed. So a lightweight cube concept was constructed. The time came for the sauna to be moved, and instead of staying indoors, the sauna needed to be in an outdoor environment. This is when the floor, roof, change room, porch, and cladding were installed.</p>
	<p>The sauna interior, heated by a Finnish electric stove that was built in the seventies, is clad in salvaged pallet boards that have been sanded down for a unique, raw look. </p>
	<p>Gotta keep the l&ouml;yly rolling.</p>

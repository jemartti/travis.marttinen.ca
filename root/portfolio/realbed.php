	<p>Headboard. Plain and simple. It took about an hour to build and is nothing fancy at all, but I really, really like it. It looks beautiful, it doesn't take up much space, you can stash your power cords behind it, you can put your mattress right on the floor, and it is super comfy to lean against. What more do you need in a bed?</p>

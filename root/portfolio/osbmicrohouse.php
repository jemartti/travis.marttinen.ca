	<h3>Material cost: TBD</h3>
	<p>This is my house. I love it very much. It is playful, raw, fun, and it does not pretend. It is what it is. And I wouldn't change a thing.</p>
	<p>I have custom, one of a kind, stringer&#8211;less plywood stairs, which will have a rock&#8211;climbing wall going up above them. All of the interior cladding is unfinished OSB, and all of the furniture and built&#8211;ins are unfinished plywood. The loft has a big hole in the middle of it to allow light and air to flow. This calls for a hammock! Yes, a hammock floor. Windows are plentiful and natural light really is not a problem. My wife even houses her entire (minimalist) paper&#8211;crafting studio inside!</p>
	<p>Everything is exposed yet simplified at the same time, resulting in a beautifully edgy aesthetic. People say "oh, you're putting OSB on your walls?" And they think that is just going to look like crap, even if they don't say it aloud. But in my opinion, it truly looks amazing in harmony with the rest of the elements of the house, especially the frameless windows that appear to not even exist.</p>
	<p>Basically, all the rules are out the window here. And then driven over. Twice. Who wants to live in one of the stuffy old houses people are building today? They suck. There is absolutely no room for fun. My philosophy is fun. We should design our houses thinking like a kid. To a kid, everything is a playground. And it should be. And that's that. So I'm making myself a playground house.</p>
	<p>We are continually purging our possessions&#8212;and construction is far from complete&#8212;yet it is starting to feel more and more like home each day :).</p>
